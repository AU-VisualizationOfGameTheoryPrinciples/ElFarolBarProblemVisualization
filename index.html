            This a Visualization of the El Farol Bar Problem in Game Theory.
        </p>
        <p>
            The base idea is that a specific number of
            people want to go to the Bar named "El Farol" on a specific day (like Thursday night). They can decide to go
            to the bar or to stay at home. But if
            the bar is too crowded the people are unhappy. The maximum number indicating when the bar attendees are
            unhappy can
            be called as
            capacity or threshold of the bar.
        </p>
        <p> So the people might need a specific strategy to determine when to go to
            the bar.
            There are different ways to define a strategy. If everyone uses the same Pure Strategy, they are certain to
            fail. So using a probablistic Mixed Strategy is a better call. Some strategies can depend on the attendance
            of past weeks to use in their strategy. The strategies which worked or would have worked in the past weeks, are more likely to be used in the next week.
